"""
Test suite for AI.HWTEXT.PHYSICAL.1A — Threshold Consistency + Physical Test Pack Stabilization (STAB-01 to STAB-10).
Validates that:
- Actual runtime thresholds match GROQ.6 validated values (0.82 / 0.40 / 0.50 / 1.20)
- Threshold drift has been resolved and no unjustified retune remains
- Synthetic fixtures are not counted as human writers
- Writer diversity claims are truthful and evidence-backed
- Trace logging defaults to False (production-safe) and has an active production guard
- Owner test checklist (A-J) and results template exist and are complete
- OCR-First architecture remains locked
