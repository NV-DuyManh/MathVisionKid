# MathVision Kids — Installed Skills Registry

> Canonical path: `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
> Legacy path (DO NOT ROUTE): `.agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

## Canonical Path Priority

1. **`.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`** — Always use this path.
2. **`.agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`** — Legacy fallback. Use ONLY if no canonical copy exists under `.agents/skills/`.

**Hard rule:** If a skill exists in both `.agents/skills/` and `.agent/skills/`, the agent MUST load from `.agents/skills/`. Loading from `.agent/skills/` when a canonical copy exists is a routing error.

## Identifier Notes

| Folder | Frontmatter `name` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `react-best-practices` | `vercel-react-best-practices` | Folder name differs from frontmatter name. Frontmatter `name` is the authoritative skill identifier used in routing matrix and reports. |

## Legacy Duplicate Status

| Original Legacy Path | Content Match | Filesystem Status | Routing Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.agent/skills/fixing-accessibility/` | Byte-identical to canonical | Moved to `.agent/skills-legacy/fixing-accessibility/` | `LEGACY_DUPLICATE_DO_NOT_ROUTE` |
| `.agent/skills/fixing-motion-performance/` | Byte-identical to canonical | Moved to `.agent/skills-legacy/fixing-motion-performance/` | `LEGACY_DUPLICATE_DO_NOT_ROUTE` |
| `.agent/skills/web-design-guidelines/` | Byte-identical to canonical | Moved to `.agent/skills-legacy/web-design-guidelines/` | `LEGACY_DUPLICATE_DO_NOT_ROUTE` |
| `.agent/skills/react-best-practices/` | Byte-identical to canonical | **Still present** (OS access denied on move) | `LEGACY_DUPLICATE_DO_NOT_ROUTE` — canonical `.agents/skills/` version must always be loaded instead |

## Workspace Rules

| Rule | Path | Activation |
|---|---|---|
